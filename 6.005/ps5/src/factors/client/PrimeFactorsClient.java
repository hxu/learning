/**
 *  PrimeFactorsClient class for PrimeFactorsServer.  
 *  
 *  Your PrimeFactorsClient class should take in Program arguments space-delimited
 *  indicating which PrimeFactorsServers it will connect to.
 *      ex. args of "localhost:4444 localhost:4445 localhost:4446"
 *          will connect the client to PrimeFactorsServers running on
 *          localhost:4444, localhost:4445, localhost:4446 
 *
 *  Your client should take user input from standard input.  The appropriate input
 *  that can be processed is a number.  If your input is not of the correct format,
 *  you should ignore it and continue to the next one.
 *  
 *  Your client should distribute to each server the appropriate range of values
 *  to look for prime factors through.
